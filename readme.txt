Makes publication easier for affiliates

== Description ==

This plugin will be useful for automatic post publication with ads. It works making a product search with key words
in which the affiliate is enrolled and posts the results automatically with 2 different styles, keeping tracking
for the affiliate.

In the text field to post we enter:
   [td tdquery="your keywords here" tdno="20" tdpg="0" tdmid="12345,234,189" tdcat="68" tdprice="20_200" td_estilo="1 o 2" prodfila="2"]

Where:
-              Tdquery: key words to search
-              Tdno: number of results to show
-              Tdpg: number of results to start from
-              Tdmid: merchant id, if several separated with commas.
-              Tdcat: category in which to search
-              Tdprice: price interval
-              Td_estilo: at the moment there are 2 styles of presentation
o             1: In the first one the user may select the number of products per row using [prodfila]
o             2: The second one will show one result per line using the whole width of the page
-              prodFila: the user may select here the number of products per line
